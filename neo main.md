# 1. Neo Script Execution Documentation

 <h1> note: numbers can be used as variable names, and they behave like so, use it if you want, or not, its up to you

```neo
set 3 30
<-> instead of outputing a interger, it outputs 30
print 3

add 3 20
<-> now its 50
print 3

exit 0
```
 </h1>

 <h1>please check <a href="neo core.md">neo core</a> first, so you know how to use core.cpp/neo properly</h1>

This guide provides instructions on how to use the core.cpp file and the main C++ code to execute Neo scripts.
Prerequisites

Before using the Neo script execution system, ensure that you have the following:

- C++ Compiler: Install a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang.

# 2. Getting Started

To use the Neo script execution system, follow these steps:

- Download core.cpp: Obtain the core.cpp file, which contains the core functionality of the Neo language, if not provided with the main code

- Set up the main C++ code: Use the provided main C++ code (with modifications if necessary) to execute the Neo script. The main C++ code should include the core.cpp file and handle the execution of Neo script lines.

- Compile the code: Compile the main C++ code along with the core.cpp file using a C++ compiler. Ensure that all necessary dependencies are properly linked.

- Execute Neo scripts: Run the compiled program and provide the path to the Neo script file as a command-line argument. The program will read the script file, execute each line of Neo code, and produce the desired output.

# 3. Writing Neo Scripts

When writing Neo scripts, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Each line of code should represent a single statement or command.

- Use proper statement syntax: Refer to the Neo language documentation for the correct syntax of each statement. Ensure that statements are properly formatted and adhere to the rules of the Neo language.

- Utilize supported statements: The core.cpp file supports various statements such as print, exit, set, mathematical operations, error handling, file inclusion, and more. Refer to the Neo language documentation for a complete list of supported statements and their syntax.

- Use comments: Comments can be added to Neo scripts using the comment character "<->". Lines starting with "<->" will be ignored during script execution.

- Include external files: To include and execute code from external files, use the `uses` statement followed by the file name. This allows code reuse and modularity in your Neo scripts.

# 4. Error Handling

The Neo script execution system provides basic error handling. If an error occurs during script execution, the program will terminate and display an error message. Common errors include:

- Incorrect usage: The program expects the Neo script file path as a command-line argument. Make sure to provide the correct usage format: "neo <file.neo>".

- Failed to open the file: If the program fails to open the specified Neo script file, ensure that the file exists and the program has appropriate read permissions.

- No exit value provided: If the executed script does not set an exit value using the exit statement, the program will display an error message and terminate. Make sure to set an appropriate exit value using the exit statement in your script.

# 5. File Structure for Compiling Neo

## Commands and Instructions

### Step 1: Generate the Project Structure

1. Create a project directory:
```
   mkdir Project_Directory
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Project_Directory
   ```

3. Create a CMakeLists.txt file (if it doesn't exist already) for CMake configuration:
   ```
   touch CMakeLists.txt
   ```

4. Create a directory for your Neo source files:
   ```
   mkdir cmake_project
   ```

5. Inside the `cmake_project` directory, create the following Neo source files:

   - `macros.h`
   - `core.cpp`
   - `main.cpp`

### Step 2: Build the Project

6. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   ```

7. Navigate to the build directory:
   ```
   cd build
   ```

8. Configure the project using CMake:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

9. Build the project (this will generate compiled files):
   ```
   make
   ```

## Project Structure

```markdown
Project Directory
|
|-- makefile (generated by CMake, do not run it, run the one in the build directory)
|
|-- cmake_project (src)
|   |
|   |-- macros.h
|   |
|   |-- core.cpp
|   |
|   |-- main.cpp
|
|-- build
|   |
|   |-- (compiled files)
|
|-- CMakeLists.txt
```

In this structure:

- `Project Directory` is the root of your project.
- `cmake_project` contains the Neo source files (`macros.h`, `core.cpp`, `main.cpp`).
- `build` is the directory where compiled files are generated.
- `CMakeLists.txt` is used for CMake configuration.

Follow the provided commands and instructions to create and build your Neo project with the specified file structure.


# 6. Conclusion

The Neo script execution system, utilizing the core.cpp file and the main C++ code, allows you to execute Neo scripts efficiently. By following the provided guidelines and using the supported statements, you can create and execute custom scripts using the Neo language. Remember to handle errors properly and adhere to the syntax and conventions of the Neo language when writing scripts.
